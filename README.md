# V79 Commerce

**Smart POS, Inventory & Supply Chain for the Vision79 ecosystem.**

V79 Commerce is a multi-tenant commerce operating system: V79 POS at the register, backed by inventory, purchasing, supplier management, logistics, predictive replenishment, customers, fulfilment, workforce controls and integration events for Vision79 Hub, FFPRO2 and V79Marketing.

## Beta workspace

The TypeScript/Fastify service now serves a responsive browser interface from the same origin as the API. Its beta screens cover checkout, register sessions, catalogue, inventory, customers, sales history, supplier product links, purchase orders, stock receiving and reorder policies. The read-only demo uses labelled sample data. Live mutations still require a verified Hub POS JWT and an active tenant membership. Advanced API features such as split tenders, refunds, lot/serial sales and offline sync still need dedicated UI and device beta testing.

### Implemented

- Strict multi-tenant membership, roles, permissions and location access
- Vision79 Hub JWT/JWKS auth foundation; development auth disabled in production
- Product catalogue, SKUs, barcodes, variants, services, serial/lot/expiry tracking
- Immutable inventory ledger and cached location balances
- FIFO inventory costing, COGS and cost-preserving branch transfers
- Full/cycle/blind stock counts with approval and variance movements
- Multi-location transfers, reservations and inventory exceptions
- POS sales, discounts, taxes, split tenders, change, returns and refunds
- Cash register sessions, opening float, paid-in/out, cash drops/pickups and reconciliation
- Customer price lists, scheduled promotions and promotion codes
- Store credit, hashed gift cards and loyalty ledgers
- Quotes, orders, invoices, layaway, deposits and partial payments
- Customer fulfilment: pickup, local delivery, shipment, dispatch and proof metadata
- Supplier/vendor management, purchase orders, approvals and partial receiving
- Landed-cost allocation, inbound shipments and logistics exception tracking
- Smart replenishment using velocity, safety stock, supplier history and dated inbound receipts
- Projected stock-out date, safety-stock breach date and must-order-by date
- MOQ/case-pack-aware recommended order quantities and draft-PO generation
- Expiry-risk notifications for stock approaching or past expiry
- Workforce profiles, cashier PIN verification, shifts and commissions
- Offline POS bootstrap/snapshot/replay foundation with idempotent sale sync
- Tenant-scoped payment-provider connection/intents/webhook boundary without raw card storage
- Transactional outbox with signed/retried delivery to Hub, FFPRO2, V79Marketing/custom endpoints
- Owner KPI dashboard, margin/inventory/supplier/logistics reports and deterministic intelligence briefing
- Immutable audit records, retention cleanup, backup and restore-test scripts
- Docker development stack, production compose template and CI validation pipeline

## Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Change local secrets and POSTGRES_PASSWORD.
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

For local development use `docker-compose.dev.yml`. The default `docker-compose.yml` is the production stack and applies the checked-in migrations. Bootstrap a development tenant/location/register:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api node apps/api/dist/scripts/bootstrap.js
```

Health:

GET /ready
```

## Production deployment

Production uses the checked-in Prisma baseline migration, validated against a fresh PostgreSQL 17 database in CI. It does not use `db push`.

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env
# Set the secrets and Hub configuration in .env.
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh
```

For an existing database volume returning Prisma P1000, follow `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and run `./scripts/repair-server.sh`. See `docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md` for validation evidence.

## Verification commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:validate
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm lint
```

CI runs these commands on pushes/PRs. A release should not be deployed if any gate fails.

## External configuration still required before a live merchant launch

These are deployment/integration inputs, not missing domain architecture:

- Vision79 Hub production JWKS/issuer/audience values and the same `V79_PLATFORM_SHARED_SECRET` used by Hub. The secret authenticates signed provisioning and summary calls; user API requests require short-lived Hub Ed25519 JWTs and an active POS membership. In Hub set `POS_BASE_URL=http://v79-commerce-api:8080` on `proxy_network`. The owner can use the Hub **Connect POS workspace** control to provision their first location/register; the Hub POS card has no Open link until a browser register exists.
- Actual WiPay/Stripe/card-terminal provider credentials and provider-specific adapter implementation/testing
- FFPRO2/V79Marketing/Hub endpoint URLs and shared webhook secrets
- SMTP/SMS/push provider configuration if those delivery channels are enabled
- Hub launch handoff integration and end-to-end device/payment beta testing

See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md` and `docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md`.
